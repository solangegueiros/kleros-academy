Let's learn the Kleros Decentralized Dispute Resolution Protocol!

We believe that the best type of learning is the hands-on experience.

We set to accomplish this through several coding tutorials, projects, and challenges defined for you.

When you sign up,
Academy will create a smart contract for each student, called portfolio,
to record all the projects you do during the course.

In the Academy smart contract itself, there will also be a monitor of your performance,
when doing multiple choice tests and projects.

## Curriculum Structure

The curriculum is splitted into
distinct modules starting with programming basics and ends with deployment of decentralized applications on Blockchain!

The course starts in the first module and progresses at a level of difficulty, sequentially to the others.
Each module builds on knowledge from the previous module.

The course makes no assumptions about your previous knowledge and it starts from the very basics of programming.

At later stages in the curriculum you will learn how to port your programming knowledge over to development on your local machine so you can begin working on your own projects!
